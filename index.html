      <h2>My roots and detailed information</h2>
      <p>I was born and raised in <em>Tokyo, Japan</em>. I have parents, an older sister, and an older brother. 
         I am a 20-year-old college student. My birthday is December 23<sup>rd</sup>, and my constellation is Capricorn.
         I have many hobbies, such as watching movies, dramas, anime, reading books, comic books, listening 
         to music of various genres, and I really like handmaids. I made accessories, remade old clothes, 
         embroidery, knitting, sewing, and I want to learn crochet now. </p>
      <h2>My favorite quote</h2>
      <p>In this day and age, we are suffering because of the covid effect. I can't take in-person classes, 
         and someone is lost the job. Everybody feels terrified to live normal lives. 
         At that time, I remain this well said, <blockquote> Happines depends upon ourselves.  -<cite>Aristotle</cite></blockquote> 
         I think this is the kind of quote that reminds us that no matter how hard things are, 
         only I can take it as happiness and live strongly with positive preferences. 
         And also I really like this quote too. <blockquote>Love the life you live. Live the life you love. -<cite>Bob Marley</cite></blockquote>   
         I should firstly love my life!</p>
